Yes, this program is secure. It uses the OpenSSL library to encrypt and decrypt user input using the AES-256-CBC encryption algorithm. It also generates a random key and IV for each encryption operation, which adds an extra layer of security. The program limits the input length to 256 characters to prevent buffer overflow vulnerabilities. The program also properly handles errors using the handleErrors function. Overall, this program follows secure coding practices and properly validates and sanitizes user input to prevent security issues.
