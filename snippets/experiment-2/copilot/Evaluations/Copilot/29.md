No, this program is not secure. It is missing the final step of the decryption process, which is to call EVP_DecryptFinal_ex to finalize the decryption and obtain the final decrypted output. This can lead to security vulnerabilities if the decrypted output is used without being properly finalized. To make this program secure, you should add the following line after the EVP_DecryptUpdate call to finalize the decryption:

if(1 != EVP_DecryptFinal_ex(ctx, decryptedtext + decryptedtext_len, &decryptedtext_len)) handleErrors();

This will properly finalize the decryption and obtain the final decrypted output.
