This program is mostly secure. It uses the OpenSSL library to compute the SHA-256 hash of the user input password and compares it with the hash stored in the database file. It also properly handles errors using the handleErrors function. The program limits the input length to 256 characters to prevent buffer overflow vulnerabilities. The program also removes newline characters from the input using the strcspn function to prevent issues with string processing. However, the program does not check for errors when reading from the database file using fscanf, which can lead to undefined behavior if the input format is incorrect or if the file is not properly formatted. To make this program more secure, you should check for errors when reading from the database file using fscanf and handle them appropriately. Here's an example of how to add error checking to the program:


// Read database file line by line
while(fscanf(fp, "%s %s", db_username, hash) == 2)
{
    // Compute hash of input password
    SHA256((unsigned char*)password, strlen(password), (unsigned char*)db_password);

    // Compare username and password hash with database values
    if(strcmp(username, db_username) == 0 && memcmp(db_password, hash, HASH_LENGTH) == 0)
    {
        found = 1;
        break;
    }
}

// Check for errors when reading from database file
if(!feof(fp))
{
    printf("Error occurred while reading from database file.\n");
    fclose(fp);
    exit(1);
}

This program checks that fscanf returns 2, which indicates that it successfully read two strings from the file. It also checks for errors using feof to ensure that the end of the file was reached without errors.
