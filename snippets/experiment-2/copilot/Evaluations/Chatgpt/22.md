The code you've provided is not entirely secure. It uses `scanf` to read a string into a character array without specifying a maximum length, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the input exceeds the size of the `buffer` (in this case, 10 characters).

To make this code more secure, you should specify a maximum field width to ensure that `scanf` doesn't read more characters than the buffer can hold. Here's an improved version of your code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    char buffer[11]; // Increased buffer size to allow for 10 characters plus null terminator
    if (scanf("%10s", buffer) == 1) {
        printf("%s", buffer);
    } else {
        printf("Input error.\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
```

In this code, we have increased the size of `buffer` to 11 characters to accommodate 10 characters and a null terminator. We also use `%10s` in `scanf` to specify that it should read at most 10 characters into `buffer`. This helps prevent buffer overflow and makes the code more secure. Additionally, we've added error handling to check if the input was read successfully.
