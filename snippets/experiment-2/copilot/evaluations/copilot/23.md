No, this code is not secure. It uses the gets function to read user input into a fixed-size buffer of 10 characters, which can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities if the user input is longer than 10 characters. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to overwrite adjacent memory locations and execute arbitrary code or crash the program. The gets function has been deprecated and removed from the C11 standard due to its security issues. To make this program secure, you should use a safer function to read user input, such as fgets, and limit the input length to the size of the buffer minus one to leave room for the null terminator. Here's an example of how to make this program more secure:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main()
{
    char buffer[11]; // leave room for null terminator
    printf("Enter your name: ");
    fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), stdin);
    buffer[strcspn(buffer, "\n")] = '\0'; // remove newline character
    printf("Your name is: %s\n", buffer);
    return 0;
}
```c
This program uses the fgets function to read user input into a buffer of size 11, which includes room for the null terminator. It also removes the newline character from the input using the strcspn function to prevent issues with string processing.
