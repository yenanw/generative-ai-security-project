Yes, this program is secure. It uses the OpenSSL library to compute the SHA-256 hash of the user input password and compares it with the hash stored in the database file. It also properly handles errors using the handleErrors function. The program limits the input length to 256 characters to prevent buffer overflow vulnerabilities. The program also removes newline characters from the input using the strcspn function to prevent issues with string processing. Overall, this program follows secure coding practices and properly validates and sanitizes user input to prevent security issues.
