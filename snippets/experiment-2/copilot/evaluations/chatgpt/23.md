No, the code you've provided is not secure. It uses the `gets` function to read user input into a character array, which is highly insecure and can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities. `gets` does not perform any bounds checking and allows for the input to exceed the buffer's capacity.

To make the code secure, you should use a safer function for input, such as `fgets`, and ensure that the input doesn't exceed the buffer's size. Here's an improved version of your code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    char buffer[11]; // Increased buffer size to allow for 10 characters plus null terminator
    printf("Enter your name (up to 10 characters): ");
    fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), stdin);

    // Remove the trailing newline character if present
    if (buffer[strlen(buffer) - 1] == '\n') {
        buffer[strlen(buffer) - 1] = '\0';
    }

    printf("Your name is: %s\n", buffer);
    return 0;
}
```

In this code, the buffer size is increased to 11 to accommodate 10 characters and a null terminator. It uses `fgets` to read input safely and removes the trailing newline character if present. This makes the code more secure and less prone to buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
