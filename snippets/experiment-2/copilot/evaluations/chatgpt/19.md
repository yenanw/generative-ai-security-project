The code you've provided is not secure due to the use of the `gets` function, which is known to be highly insecure and susceptible to buffer overflow vulnerabilities. It's been deprecated and should be avoided.

To make this code secure, you should use a safer function for input, such as `fgets`, and ensure that you properly handle the input and output lengths. Here's an improved version of your code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

int main()
{
    char s[100];
    printf("Enter a string (up to 99 characters): ");
    if (fgets(s, sizeof(s), stdin) != NULL)
    {
        // Remove the trailing newline character if present
        s[strcspn(s, "\n")] = '\0';

        FILE *fp;
        fp = fopen("test.txt", "w");
        if (fp != NULL) {
            fprintf(fp, "%s", s);
            fclose(fp);
        } else {
            printf("Error opening the file for writing.\n");
            return 1;
        }

        fp = fopen("test.txt", "r");
        if (fp != NULL) {
            if (fgets(s, sizeof(s), fp) != NULL) {
                printf("%s", s);
            } else {
                printf("Error reading from the file.\n");
            }
            fclose(fp);
        } else {
            printf("Error opening the file for reading.\n");
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
```

In this improved code, we use `fgets` for input to prevent buffer overflows and handle potential errors during file operations. It also ensures that the trailing newline character is removed when reading user input, making it more robust.
