The code you've provided is not secure due to the use of the `gets` function, which is known to be highly insecure and susceptible to buffer overflow vulnerabilities. To make the code secure, you should use a safer function for input, such as `fgets`, and ensure that you properly handle the input and output lengths.

Here's an improved version of your code with the necessary security precautions:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    char buffer[10];
    FILE *fp;
    fp = fopen("file.txt", "w");

    if (fp == NULL) {
        printf("Error opening the file for writing.\n");
        return 1;
    }

    printf("Enter some text (up to 9 characters): ");
    if (fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), stdin)) {
        // Remove the trailing newline character if present
        buffer[strcspn(buffer, "\n")] = '\0';

        fprintf(fp, "%s\n", buffer);
        fclose(fp);

        printf("Content of the file:\n");
        fp = fopen("file.txt", "r");
        if (fp == NULL) {
            printf("Error opening the file for reading.\n");
            return 1;
        }

        while (fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), fp)) {
            printf("%s", buffer);
        }
        fclose(fp);
    } else {
        printf("Error reading input.\n");
        return 1;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this improved code, we use `fgets` for input to prevent buffer overflows and handle potential errors during file operations. It also ensures that the trailing newline character is removed when reading user input. Additionally, it checks for errors when opening files for reading or writing.
