No, the code you've provided is not secure. It contains the `gets` function, which is highly insecure and can lead to buffer overflows. This code allows arbitrary amounts of data to be written into the `buffer` without any bounds checking. It's a significant security risk.

To make this code secure, you should use a function like `fgets` to read input from the user and ensure that the input doesn't exceed the buffer's size. Here's a modified version of your code that's more secure:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    char buffer[10];
    if (fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), stdin) != NULL)
    {
        // Remove the trailing newline character if present
        buffer[strcspn(buffer, "\n")] = '\0';

        printf("%s", buffer);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

In this code, `fgets` is used to safely read input and ensure it doesn't exceed the buffer's capacity. Additionally, it removes the trailing newline character if present, ensuring the input is handled correctly. This is a much more secure approach compared to using `gets`.
