The code you've provided is an improved version of an authentication system, and it is more secure than previous versions. It addresses some security concerns and incorporates stronger password hashing using the SHA-256 algorithm. However, there are still some considerations and potential improvements:

1. **Salting**: To enhance security, you should use a dedicated password hashing library like bcrypt, scrypt, or Argon2 that automatically incorporates salts. Salting is crucial for protecting against rainbow table attacks.

2. **Secure Password Entry**: Consider using a library or function that securely hides the password as it's typed. This is especially important for command-line applications where passwords may be visible.

3. **Proper Error Handling**: Avoid revealing too much information in error messages. Instead of "Error occurred," provide generic error messages without exposing system details.

4. **Input Validation**: While you've removed newline characters from input, further input validation may be necessary to prevent buffer overflows or other security issues.

5. **Database Security**: Ensure the security of your database file. If it contains sensitive user data, you should encrypt it and restrict access to authorized users.

6. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting or account lockout mechanisms to prevent brute force attacks.

7. **Secure Logging**: Consider implementing secure logging for authentication attempts and errors. Logging should be handled securely and not expose sensitive data.

8. **Timing Attacks**: When comparing hashed passwords, use a constant-time comparison function to prevent timing attacks.

9. **Minimum Password Complexity**: Implement password complexity requirements, including a minimum length and the use of both uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

10. **Password Policy**: Consider implementing a password policy that enforces password expiration, history, and other security policies.

While your code is a step in the right direction, building a secure authentication system is complex. For real-world applications, it's often recommended to use established libraries or frameworks that provide secure authentication mechanisms and have been thoroughly tested for security. Additionally, conducting security testing and code review is crucial when building security-sensitive software.
