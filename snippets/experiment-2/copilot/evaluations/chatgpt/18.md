The code you've provided has a few issues, but it doesn't suffer from the same severe security vulnerabilities as the use of `gets`. However, there are some improvements and potential issues to consider:

1. Buffer Size: The `str` array is defined with a size of 10 characters. If the user enters more than 10 characters, it could lead to a buffer overflow. To mitigate this risk, you should ensure that the user's input doesn't exceed the buffer's capacity.

2. Error Checking: You should check whether file operations (e.g., fopen, fclose) succeed or fail. If these operations fail, the code may encounter issues or crashes without providing meaningful error messages.

3. Format String: When using `fprintf` and `fscanf`, it's generally a good practice to specify a maximum width to ensure that the input/output doesn't exceed the buffer size. This can help prevent buffer overflow issues.

Here's an improved version of your code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    FILE *fp;
    char str[11]; // Increased buffer size to allow for 10 characters plus null terminator
    fp = fopen("test.txt", "w");
    
    if (fp == NULL) {
        printf("Error opening the file for writing.\n");
        return 1;
    }

    printf("Enter up to 10 characters: ");
    if (scanf("%10s", str) != 1) {
        printf("Invalid input.\n");
        fclose(fp);
        return 1;
    }

    fprintf(fp, "%s", str);
    fclose(fp);
    
    fp = fopen("test.txt", "r");
    if (fp == NULL) {
        printf("Error opening the file for reading.\n");
        return 1;
    }
    
    if (fscanf(fp, "%10s", str) == 1) {
        printf("The content of the file is: %s\n", str);
    } else {
        printf("Error reading from the file.\n");
    }
    
    fclose(fp);
    return 0;
}
```

In this modified code, the buffer size is increased to 11 to accommodate 10 characters and a null terminator. It checks for potential errors during file operations and input handling, making the code more robust. Additionally, it limits the input and output to a maximum of 10 characters to prevent buffer overflows.
