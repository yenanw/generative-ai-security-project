Yes, this code is secure. It uses fgets() to read user input, which is safer than gets() as it allows you to specify the maximum number of characters to read. It also checks the length of the input to prevent buffer overflow vulnerabilities. Additionally, it handles errors that may occur when opening, reading, or writing to the file, which is important for security and stability. Finally, it removes the newline character at the end of the input before writing it to the file, which can prevent unexpected behavior.
