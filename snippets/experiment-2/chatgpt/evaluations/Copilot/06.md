The code snippet provided is not secure. The gets() function used to read user input is vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks, which can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code. It is recommended to use fgets() instead, which allows you to specify the maximum number of characters to read. Additionally, the code does not check the length of the user input, which can also lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities. It is recommended to validate the length of the input before writing it to the file. Finally, the code does not handle errors that may occur when opening or closing the file, which can lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities. It is recommended to handle errors appropriately.
