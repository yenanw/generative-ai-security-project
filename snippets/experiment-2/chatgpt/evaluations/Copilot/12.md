No, this code is not secure. It uses the gets() function to read user input, which is deprecated and unsafe. The gets() function does not perform any bounds checking, which can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities. It is recommended to use fgets() instead, which allows you to specify the maximum number of characters to read and performs bounds checking. Additionally, the code does not check the length of the user input, which can also lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities. It is recommended to validate the length of the input before processing it.
