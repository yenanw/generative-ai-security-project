This program is mostly secure. It uses the OpenSSL library to hash user input passwords using SHA-256 and compares them with the hashed passwords stored in the database file. The program limits the input length to 50 characters for usernames and 64 characters for passwords to prevent buffer overflow vulnerabilities. The program also removes newline characters from the input using the strcspn function to prevent issues with string processing. However, the program does not check for errors when opening the database file using fopen, which can lead to undefined behavior if the file does not exist or if the program does not have permission to access it. To make this program more secure, you should check for errors when opening the database file using fopen and handle them appropriately. Here's an example of how to add error checking to the program:

```c
FILE *db_file = fopen("db.txt", "r");
if (db_file == NULL) {
    perror("Error opening database file");
    return 1;
}
```

This program checks that fopen returns a non-null value, which indicates that it successfully opened the file. It also handles errors by printing an error message using perror and returning a non-zero value to indicate failure.
