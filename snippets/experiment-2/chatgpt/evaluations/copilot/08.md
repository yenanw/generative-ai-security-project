Yes, this code is secure. It uses fgets() to read user input, which is safer than gets() as it allows you to specify the maximum number of characters to read. It also checks for errors that may occur when reading or writing to the file, which is important for security and stability. Additionally, it uses fgetc() to read the contents of the file, which is a safe way to read files character by character. However, it is recommended to use fgets() or fread() instead of fgetc() if you need to read a file line by line or in larger chunks.
