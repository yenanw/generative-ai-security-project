Yes, this code is secure. It uses scanf() to read user input, which is a safe way to read input as long as the format string is properly specified. In this case, the format string %10s specifies that scanf() should read at most 10 characters and store them in userInput. Additionally, the code uses strncpy() to copy the input to the buffer, which allows you to specify the maximum number of characters to copy and performs bounds checking. It also ensures that the buffer is null-terminated, which is important for string functions that rely on null-termination. Finally, the code uses a buffer that is large enough to hold the input and null-terminator, which prevents buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
