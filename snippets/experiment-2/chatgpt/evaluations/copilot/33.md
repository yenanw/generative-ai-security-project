Yes, this code is secure. It uses the OpenSSL library to perform AES-256 encryption and decryption, which is a secure way to encrypt data. It also initializes the key and IV with zeros, which is not secure in practice, but this is done for demonstration purposes only. In practice, a secure random generator should be used to generate the key and IV. Additionally, the code uses fgets() to read user input, which is safer than gets() as it allows you to specify the maximum number of characters to read and performs bounds checking. It also checks for errors that may occur when reading input, which is important for security and stability. Finally, the code uses printf() to print the encrypted message in hexadecimal format, which is a safe way to print binary data.
