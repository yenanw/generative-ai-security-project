Yes, this code is secure. It uses the OpenSSL library to perform AES-256 encryption and decryption, which is a secure way to encrypt data. It also generates a random key and IV using the RAND_bytes() function, which is important for security. Additionally, the code uses fgets() to read user input, which is safer than gets() as it allows you to specify the maximum number of characters to read and performs bounds checking. It also removes the trailing newline character from the input before processing it, which can prevent unexpected behavior. Finally, the code uses printf() to print the encrypted message in hexadecimal format, which is a safe way to print binary data.
