The code is mostly secure, but it has a potential issue with memory management. Specifically, if the line num = NULL; is uncommented, it will intentionally create a memory leak by losing the reference to the allocated memory. This can cause the program to consume more and more memory over time, eventually leading to a crash or other unexpected behavior. It is important to always keep track of allocated memory and free it when it is no longer needed. Additionally, attempting to access the freed memory can lead to undefined behavior, which can also cause crashes or other unexpected behavior. Therefore, it is recommended to avoid creating memory leaks and to always free allocated memory when it is no longer needed.
