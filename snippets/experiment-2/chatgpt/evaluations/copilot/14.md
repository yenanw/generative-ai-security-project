Yes, this code is secure. It uses fgets() to read user input, which is safer than gets() as it allows you to specify the maximum number of characters to read and performs bounds checking. Additionally, the code checks for errors that may occur when reading input, which is important for security and stability. It also removes the trailing newline character from the input before processing it, which can prevent unexpected behavior. Finally, the code uses strncpy() to copy the input to the buffer, which allows you to specify the maximum number of characters to copy and performs bounds checking. It also ensures that the buffer is null-terminated, which is important for string functions that rely on null-termination.
