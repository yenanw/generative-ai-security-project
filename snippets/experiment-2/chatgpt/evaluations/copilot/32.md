Yes, this code is secure. It uses fgets() to read user input, which is safer than gets() as it allows you to specify the maximum number of characters to read. It also checks for errors that may occur when opening, reading, or writing to the file, which is important for security and stability. Additionally, it uses the SHA-256 algorithm to hash passwords, which is a secure way to store passwords. It also combines the password and a secret key before hashing, which adds an extra layer of security. Finally, it uses strcmp() to compare strings, which is a safe way to compare strings.
